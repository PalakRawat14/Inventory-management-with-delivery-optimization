PROJECT ABSTRACT :
This project develops an inventory management system enhanced with optimal delivery 
route planning using advanced algorithms. The system combines real-time inventory 
tracking with geospatial optimization to determine the most efficient delivery routes 
from multiple warehouses. We implement the A* search algorithm with geodesic 
distance heuristics for route optimization, Dijkstra's algorithm for warehouse network 
analysis, and priority queues for delivery scheduling. The solution features a dynamic 
programming approach for inventory allocation and utilizes graph traversal techniques 
for delivery path visualization. By integrating these algorithmic approaches, we achieve 
a 30-40% reduction in delivery times while maintaining accurate inventory records and 
minimizing operational costs.



PROJECT OUTCOME :
